                                            As we look forward to the
                                            new year, we all look
                                            forward to change and
                                            betterment. Sometimes we
                                            want to leave behind old
                                            habits and take on new ones.
                                            One such habit that we want
                                            to consciously let go is
                                            'sir' culture and imbibe <b>
                                              'first name' </b> basis.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Let's try to understand how
                                            we arrived at this 'sir'
                                            culture. In India, we always
                                            give respect to the other
                                            person, especially elders.
                                            Be it calling 'bhaiya' or
                                            'anna' , 'ben' or 'didi'.
                                            This habit is inculcated in
                                            the child and respect is
                                            often associated with these
                                            words. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            As we grow up and get out of
                                            our homes into schools, we
                                            are taught the sacred
                                            relationship between 'guru
                                            and disciple'. No doubt that
                                            this is an important aspect
                                            of our lives. We spent 5
                                            minutes in every period
                                            singing 'Good Morning
                                            teacher/miss' or 'Good
                                            morning Mam/sir'. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            What is interesting to
                                            remember is that most of the
                                            education system we follow
                                            today was established in the
                                            colonial raj. Whereas an
                                            Englishman needs to get
                                            knighted by the Queen to
                                            become a 'sir' in England.
                                            In India, 'sir' just became
                                            a common prefix/suffix. All
                                            Englishmen/women became
                                            'Saheb' or 'Sir' and
                                            'Memsahib' or 'Madam'.
                                            Somewhere in the transition
                                            to a modern India, the
                                            parampara was all but
                                            obfuscated. Now we blindly
                                            associate ‘Sir’ with
                                            respect. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            While the British have long
                                            moved on, we continue to
                                            excel in subservience. This
                                            is heavily evident in the
                                            bureaucratic machinery. From
                                            'Sir nahi aye hai' to 'Mam
                                            ko puchna padega' to 'sir ke
                                            liye nashta pani' and the
                                            list continues. Similarly,
                                            in the military where the
                                            chain of command plays an
                                            important role the use of
                                            'yes sir' cannot be
                                            dismissed. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            However, in a corporate
                                            professional environment
                                            'sir' does not really have
                                            any added advantage. Yet, we
                                            keep associating 'sir' with
                                            respect. We need to
                                            understand that respect
                                            doesn't live in just one
                                            expression of 'sir'. They
                                            can be other ways of showing
                                            respect. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Talking on a first name
                                            basis is not going to change
                                            the way we respect our
                                            seniors. It is only going to
                                            change the way we
                                            communicate. Maybe we can
                                            use 'ji' as a suffix or none
                                            at all. <br>
